# Redgate Tech Test

## The challenge
To design a piece of research to gather some quantitative data in order to understand whether the coding habits of software engineers change over the winter holiday period (in comparison to the rest of the year).



## List of things to add/refactor if more time was avalible
Due to unfortunate circumstances I only saw that I had recieved this test on the 1st of January. As such there is definatly further improvements and refactors that could be made such as:
- Guard claues on ask method if statement to prevent blank answers.
- Find a better way to test the servey that doesn't involve having to answer the questions everytime. Would need to look into stubs and mocks again to try and discover a solution
