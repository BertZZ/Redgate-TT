# Redgate Tech Test

## The challenge
To design a piece of research to gather some quantitative data in order to understand whether the coding habits of software engineers change over the winter holiday period (in comparison to the rest of the year).

## The program
This program is a command line survey that asks 12 questions designed to gather data on software engineering habits over winter holidays. The Null Hypothesis is that the winter holidays do not effect the programing behaviours of software engineers. The program asks 12 questions and also provides some analysis methods for basic statistical analysis.


## List of things to add/refactor.
Due to unfortunate circumstances I only saw that I had recieved this test on the 1st of January. As such there is definatly further improvements and refactors that could be made such as:
- Guard claues on ask method if statement to prevent blank answers.
- Find a better way to test the survey that doesn't involve having to answer the questions everytime in RSpec.
